Student Name: Morshedul Islam Maruf.
Flutter Course: Batch 10.

## Assignment 2 Details:

Make a responsive UI that shows a number of cards in a row based on the screen size.

## Requirements:
1. The cards should be responsive. The contents of the card and the card it self should be 
   responsive, meaning it should adjust its size based on the screen size.
2. Card count per row based on the screen size:
   - Mobile: ScreenWidth < 420 = show 1 card (It was not require in the assignment)
   - Tablet: ScreenWidth < 768 = show 2 cards
   - Desktop: ScreenWidth < 1024 = show 3 cards
   - Large Desktop: ScreenWidth > 1024 show 4 cards
3. A example UI was given to match the design with the assignment. Had to match 
   at least 70% of the contents (Instructor suggested to replace the image in the UI with different country flags)

Note: I couldn't attach the image of the example UI, I will try to attach it later.
